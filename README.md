# Alby, as your manager

Hi my name is Alby Barber, nice to meet you!

Here are some of my philosophies that will hopefully be helpful, as we work together.

I’m here to firstly help and support you, provide you with opportunities, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.

## I’m here for you, and always up for a chat.
My calendar is sometimes can look full but I encourage you to schedule something with me, if you want to talk. If you see a good time on my calendar, please schedule something (you don’t need to ask first). I’ll be there (my Google Calendar is 99.9% accurate). If something comes up that is urgent, I am very happy to drop everything to help, just send me a message on Slack message and I’ll make time. If you need to reschedule something, that is not a problem! I endeavor to make all of my calendar events with modify privileges and you should feel free to go ahead and move it to some other time slot that’s within business hours and not conflicting with other meetings.
